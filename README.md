dotfiles
========

Here's my collection of dotfiles. I originally started from scratch, but then plundered large sections of [hrs](https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles)'s, so a big shout-out to Harry Schwartz (thanks, Harry!).

I probably wouldn't recommend that anyone else use mine, but nonetheless:

#### Installation

1. Clone the repo into ~/.dotfiles
2. `cd` into the repo and run `ruby install.rb`
3. If it complains that it skipped something, rename the offending file to `<filename>.local` and repeat step 2.
